I'm a Software Developer at Indeed Tokyo.
Indeed is currently hiring for many positions in 
[San Francisco, Austin, Seattle, Tokyo and Hyperabad](http://app.jobvite.com/m?3n4OAhwB).

I started writing this blog for different reasons :
get better at writing technical content in English, 
motivate me to dig deeper into the subjects I study, and finally to learn how to grow an audience... 
But let's be honest : I do appreciate ego-boost as much as the next man, and enjoy showering myself with internet Kharma.

The posts are mostly about puzzles I stumbled upon,  actual real world technical problems I encounterred during my everyday job, or just small hacks I thought about.

They revolve around my interests : algorithm, math, search technologies, machine learning and single-page JS application.
