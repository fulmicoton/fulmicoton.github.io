Comparison sort complexity
------------------------------------------------

In my first post I dropped a line about ``525`` being the theoretical minimal number of comparison required to sort a list of ``100`` elements without explaining it. I will do so here, and show how the same thought process can help solving the 12 pearls puzzle.

Let's got through a [thought experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment).
Let's imagine you are playing a game with a friend. 
You are locked in a room and your friend is outside, holding a randomly shuffled deck of cards marked with numbers ranging from 1 to N. You have a similar deck of card, but sorted. 
Your goal is to put it in the same order as the deck of your friend. The only questions you can ask him are of the form "is the card at position ``#6`` shows a bigger number than the card at the position ``#29``?"  and the guy from the other side will answer you by yes or no. 

We assume you are a very reasonable person and that you are asking your questions determiniscally. In other words, if you played the game a second time, you would ask the same questions as long you got the same answers.

Let's have you play the game a LOT of times, we could log in a book 
the shuffle of the cards and the answers you got for each questions.
The book would look  something like :

``[ 3, 17, 29, 12, ..., 15 ]: Yes No Yes Yes No No Yes``

For two different shuffle, you cannot possibly have gotten the exact same series of answer, because if it was so, you wouldn't had enough information to discriminate between the two shuffle when you were playing.

In other words, if you were to play all the possible ``n!`` (factorial n) shuffle, you would have gotten ``n!``- different series of answers.
Now let's call C the highest number of questions you had to ask 
to finish a game. 2<sup>C</sup> is an upper bound for the number of series of answer you had. We therefore have 

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2^C \geq n!" title="2^C \geq n!" />


The algorithm you ran as you were playing is called a comparison sort. C is the worst-case complexity of your algorithm.

Apply the log to the inequation leads us to 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C \geq log_2 (n! )" title="C \geq log_2 (n!)" />

How smart could you be, you will never be able to think about a strategy for which you can sort out your deck of card in less than 
``log_2 (n!)`` questions all the time.

This result is usually presented as the best possible complexity for a comparison sort is ``n ln n``. 
This can be shown very easily by using the [Stirling formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling's_approximation).

**In the rest of this post, I'll try to show that this kind of reasonning can actually help solving problems the 12 pearls puzzle.**




The 12 pearls puzzle
-------------------------


![Guess who](/images/pearls/balance_scale.jpg)

You've been given 12 pearls and a balance scale 
like the one in the picture. It has two plates, and you 
can compare the weight of the things you put on each plates.

One of the pearl is fake, and you don't know which one.
All pearls have the very same weight, except for the fake one which is either heavier or lighter (and you don't know which).

The problem consists of finding out which pearls is fake and whether it is heavier of lighter, by using the balance scale at most three times.




Three times can't be enough?
------------------------------------

*Spoiler alert. If like me, you like puzzles, you might 
want to stop reading now, and come back after you solved it.*


The problem is intentionnally misleading. You might think that 
the balance gives you only two outputs : "heavier" or "lighter".

If it was so, using the same argument as before, we can show that using the balance three times will make it only possible to discriminate within 2<sup>3</sup>=8 configurations.

But in this problem, your answer consists of identifying the fake pearl (12 candidates) and whether it is lighter or heavier. The problems has 24 possible different answers, which is greater than 8.

The first trick is to notice that such a balance has a ternary output. It may tell you that the objects on both plates have the exact same weight. That's 3<sup>3</sup>=27 which is greater than 24. 


Finding out the first weighting with no sweat
--------------------------------------------------------------


Now let's consider the first weighting. First we reject the possibility of putting a different number of pearls in each plate,
as it doesn't much information if the balance goes in the direction of bigger number.

The first weighting will be of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 pearls on each plate.

Let's show how a simple reasonning will let us get rid of some of these options. After this first weighting, we will have only 2 shot to find our pearls. With two weighting we can at most discriminate between 3<sup>2</sup> = 9 possibilities.

For 1, 2, 3, if the scale tells us that the two plates have equal weights, we will only know that the fake pearl is within the remaining 10, 8, 6 pearls. We won't have any info about the fake pearl being heavier or lighter either. That's respectively 20, 16, or 12 possible answers. We won't be able to discriminate that many answer with only 2 weighting. 1,2,3 are therefore not an option.

Now let's consider weighting 5 pearls against 5 pearls, or 6 pearls against 6 pearls. If the scale outputs that the left plate is heavier than the right plate, we will be sticked with the possibilities that either the fake pearl is within the left plate 
and is heavier, (respectively 5 and  6 possibilities) or that the fake pearl is in the right plate and is lighter than the other pearls (respectively 5 and 6 possibilities). Overall we will have to 
discriminate between 10 or 12 possibilities with two weighting, which is impossible.

We haven't explored any of the possibilities, yet we showed that **the only possible first move is to weight 4 pearls against 4 other pearls !**




A naive implementation
------------------------------------

Let's now try to write an algorithm that solves this problem 
for n pearls. More accurately, it will return, given n, the minimal number of measures to solve the problem for n pearls. The first implementation will be very naive and have a complexity I honestly don't want to think about. It will help however to give some reality to some of the concept I talked about.

We will go through all possible weighting, while keeping a list of all the remaining answer that are still possible. For each weighting we will consider the new list of possible configurations if we get each of the three output from the scale... A bit like you would do in a game of *Guess Who?*. We keep a list of all the possible answers, and ask questions and depending on the answer of the questions, we get rid of the solutions one by one.

Cutting branches
--------------------------------

With the naive implementation, things are going reaaallllly slow starting ``n=5``. It is slow because recursive calls themselves perform recursive calls and so on. 
Your program is like running through a gigantic tree. And how do you get gigantic trees thinner? You cut its branches of course.

One simple way to cut branches for instance, would be to let the different calls know about the current best result. That way, as soon as they detect they won't be able to beat the high score, they can just stop exploring this branch. I won't implement this optimization here. What I am going to do is return results directly if I reached a theoretical minimum. If I find a solution that finds our fake pearl in ``ceil(log_3(len(population)))`` measures, then I can just stop exploring sibling branches.

Not much has changed right? Our algorithm performs slightly better. We can now compute in 15s the solution of our problem for ``n=7``. We still cannot solve our initial problem, which is for ``n=12``. 
How can we do it better?

A good trick is to try to cut branches as soon as possible. In our cases, it would be nice to check start exploring the branch that are more promising first. That way if there is a perfect answer we will find it sooner.

To do so we only need to tune our population after measures method.
We will sort it in order to have the measures splitting the population as evenly as possible first.

That doesn't look like to promising, but it is actually a huge improvement on the previous algorithm. We can now solve our problem for 12 pearls!

**So let's sum up what we did here! We cut branches by returning results if we have some way to know they are optimal. We try to find those optimal faster by going through the most promising ones first. We also saw but didn't implement the fact that stopping as soon as we detect we won't be able to do as well as our siblings.**

Being more human
--------------------------------

Still, people solve this problem right? They're definitely doing something smarter than this, or it would take them days to find the 
solution. 

I think the difference lies the way our brain pictures
a population and the way the previous algorithm does. My brain doesn't consider all the combinations like we do here, but understands how pearl 1 and pearl 2 are playing symmetric roles.

For the last algorithm we will try to sum up a population by a tuple (n,l,h,r) where 

- n is the number of pearls for which we don't know anything
- l is the number of pearls for which we know that if they are fake, they are heavier
- h is the number of pearls for which we know that if they are fake, they are lighter
- r is the number of pearls for which we know that they are real.

This greatly reduce the number of branch in our tree. In addition, the space of the possible arguments with which solve is called with is small enought to cache the results.

*(I erased the previous mention of an implementation which was not as performant as the one below, and a lot more difficult to understand.)*

The other great benefits is that it makes it a mathematical object which is much easier to grasp.

Let's call ``c(n,l,h,r)`` the function that gives us the minimum number of weighting required by the best strategy possible. 
We will also call p the function of our initial problem, that is :
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p: n \rightarrow c(n,0,0,0)" title="p: n \rightarrow c(n,0,0,0)" />.

With some good coffee, paper and pen it is actually easy to prove that there exists a solution to solve the pearl problem for n=3<sup>k</sup> in k+1 weightings.


In terms of our function ``p``, we have
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\forall k\geq1,~ p(3^k) \leq k+1" title="\forall k\geq1,~ p(3^k) \leq k+1" />

That's actually a very strong result because, as we have shown it before, we also know that 

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\forall k\geq1,~ p(3^k)^3 \geq 2 \times 3^k" title="\forall k\geq1,~ p(3^k)^3 \geq 2 \times 3^k" />

Applying the log, we can get very tight boundaries for c(3<sup>k) :
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\forall k\geq1,~ log_3(2) + 3^k \leq p(3^k) \leq 1+3^k" title="\forall k\geq1,~ log_3(2) + 3^k \leq p(3^k) \leq 1+3^k" />.

This interval actually contains only one integer, we have proven that :
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\forall k\geq1,~ p(3^k) = 1+3^k" title="\forall k\geq1,~ p(3^k) = 1+3^k" />

It is also possible to show that the function c is increasing, so that for all n, 

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?3^k \leq n\leq 3^{k+1} \Rightarrow k+1~ \leq c(n) \leq k+2" title="3^k \leq n\leq 3^{k+1} \Rightarrow k+1~ \leq c(n) \leq k+2" />

So for all n, we actually have only two possible values. Surely we can use that for optimization! Imagine that : as soon as we get a solution with a cost of the lower bound we can return, as soon as we show that a solution will not reach the lower bound we can return.

Here goes the implemementation :
